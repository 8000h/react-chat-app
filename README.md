# GravityKit org...

Hi! My name is Zack Katz and I'm interested in the `gravitykit` org name. I'm in the process of a rebrand and have `GravityKitWP`, but would love to use `GravityKit` instead.

I would like to know whether you're open to the idea of renaming your org, and how we can make that happen.

Please send me an email at [zack@katz.co](mailto:zack@katz.co); I'd like to start a conversation that leads to a good outcome for both of us!

Thanks,
Zack Katz
